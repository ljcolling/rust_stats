//! Things I've done to make R's nmath library work
//!   1. Copied the nmath source
//!   2. Set `MATHLIB_STANDALONE`: telling nmath to build for use outside R
//!   3. Copied R's includes since they are still needed even with `MATHLIB_STANDALONE`.
//!   4. Copy `Rconfig.h` and `config.h` from the mingw dir (normally these files would be
//!      generated, but I think the math libs use very little of them).
//!   5. Copy `Rmath.h` from `Rmath.h0.in` and replace the build system placeholders (there are
//!      only 2).
//!   6. Manually whitelist the functions to include, otherwise we pull in a lot of stuff,
//!      including stuff outside the source tree (and also it doesn't compile for some reason).
//!   7. `Rmath.h` wierdly sets the normal functions as aliases - we have to use the raw function
//!      name here e.g. `dnorm4`.
//!
//! I've done some work on rust versions of these functions in the `riir` branch. This branch
//! should be used for testing those functions in future.
//!
//! R is released as GPLv2 which I interpret as meaning this library must also be released as
//! GPLv2. If all the functions were replaced with native rust ones, then the license could be
//! changed to something more permissive.

/// This module provides the output of bindgen, in case the raw functions are useful.
